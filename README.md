## Context
[Jon](https://github.com/jonallured)'s amazing [pear](https://github.com/jonallured/pear) is a tool many of us use, here at Artsy. Often we have new engineers joining us, and we wanted an easy way to add their data to our `.pear-data`. Now we have them all in this repo, and anyone can add more, themselves or others.
