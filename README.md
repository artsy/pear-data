# Artsy's `.pear-data` ðŸ’œ

## Get latest and merge with your local .pear-data

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artsy/pear-data/main/.pear-data --output /tmp/artsy-pear-data
jq -s '{ current: .[0].current, known: (.[1].known + .[0].known) | unique }' ~/.pear-data /tmp/artsy-pear-data > ~/.pear-data
```

### First time using it?
Just use the file as is!
```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artsy/pear-data/main/.pear-data --output ~/.pear-data
```

## Add yourself!
Simply modify the [`data.csv`](https://github.com/artsy/pear-data/blob/main/data.csv) file with your name, username and email that you use for GitHub, and make a PR. GitHub Actions should take it from there, to generate the actual `.pear-data` json file.

## Context
[Jon](https://github.com/jonallured)'s amazing [pear](https://github.com/jonallured/pear) is a tool many of us use, here at Artsy. Often we have new engineers joining us, and we wanted an easy way to add their data to our `.pear-data`. Now we have them all in this repo, and anyone can add more, themselves or others.
